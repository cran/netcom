\title{Grow a Preferential Attachment Network}
\usage{
grow_PA(
  matrix,
  x,
  power,
  sum_v_max = "sum",
  nascent_help = TRUE,
  retcon = FALSE,
  directed = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix}{Existing network to experience growth.}

\item{x}{The ID of the node to be grown.}

\item{power}{Power of attachment, which determines how much new nodes prefer to attach to nodes that have many edges compared to few. Needs to be positive.}

\item{sum_v_max}{Degree distributions must be normalized, either by their "max" or "sum". Defaults to "max".}

\item{nascent_help}{Should a single edge be added to the degree distribution of all nodes so that nodes with a zero in-degree can still have a chance of being attached to by new nodes. Defaults to TRUE.}

\item{retcon}{Binary variable determining if already existing nodes can attach to new nodes. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{directed}{Binary variable determining if the network is directed, resulting in off-diagonal asymmetry in the adjacency matrix. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
An adjacency matrix.
}
\description{
Grows an already existing network by adding a node according to the Preferential Attachment mechanism. Nodes can only attach to previously grown nodes.
}
\details{
Adds a node in a network according to the Preferential Attachment mechanism.
