#' @title Induced Conserved Structure (ICS)
#'
#' @description Calculates the Induced Conserved Structure proposed by Patro and Kingsford (2012) of an alignment between two networks.
#'
#' @param network_1_input The first network being aligned, which must be in matrix form. If the two
#' networks are of different sizes, it will be easier to interpret the output if this is the smaller one.
#'
#' @param network_2_input The second network, which also must be a matrix.
#'
#' @param alignment A matrix, such as is output by the function NetCom, where the first two columns contain
#' corresponding node IDs for the two networks that were aligned.
#' 
#' @param flip Defaults to FALSE. Set to TRUE if the first network is larger than the second. This is necessary 
#' because ICS is not a symmetric measure of alignment quality. 
#'
#' @return A number ranging between 0 and 1. If the Induced Conserved Structure is 1, the two networks are
#' isomorphic (identical) under the given alignment.
